# Numerical-Algebra-code


This repository contains C++ code implementing matrix algorithms using the STL library. It serves as the course project for **USTC 001125.01 Numerical Algebra**. The code covers various matrix operations and algorithms, providing a practical demonstration of numerical algebra concepts.

----

 Specifically, in this project, we have mainly implemented the following matrix algorithms:
  - Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting and Full Pivoting
  - QR Decomposition
  - Jacobi Iteration, Gauss-Seidel Iteration, and Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)
  - Conjugate Gradient Method
  - QR Method for Eigenvalue Computation
  - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) with Implicit QR
